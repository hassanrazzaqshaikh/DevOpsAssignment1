Agile is software development methodology focus on quick development and quick delivery. 

** Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment **
CI and CD stand for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably. Automated build-and-test steps triggered by CI ensure that code changes being merged into the repository are reliable. The code is then delivered quickly and seamlessly as a part of the CD process. In the software world, the CI/CD pipeline refers to the automation that enables incremental code changes from developersâ€™ desktops to be delivered quickly and reliably to production.
